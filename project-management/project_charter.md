## Introduction / Management Summary

### Purpose: 

This Project charter describes on a high level what has to happen for the **Business Application Flight Booking Software** project. The information in this document must provide a full and firm foundation to project owner to be able to decide on the start of the project. T his means either moving forward towards to start the project and organization or stop the project because achieving the goal, or the business case is not feasible, within the constraints defined.

This document formulates why this project is relevant (section 2). It gives a definition of the project, and an initial break up on who is involved, when and how, in the process of delivering all the products (section 3). The choice of solution and approach that will be used is described, taking into account various considerations, in section 4. In section 5 the customer quality expectations and acceptance criteria are formulated, because they will be evaluated at the end of the project. Based on the material from section 2 up to 5 initial lead time and effort estimates are derived in section 6. An outline business case in section 7 contains an initial statement on costs and benefits that form the expected net benefit of this project.
By this setup the Project Charter describes a first full iteration around the “project square” from scope (S), through quality (Q) a long time & effort (T) into budget (B). The items Risks (R) and Organization (O) complete the project description in this Project Charter.

### Advice

Based on the analysis carried for this Project Charter 
the proposal is to continue with the project and to 
develop the application for the given scope.

The Business and IT costs for **Business Application 
Flight Booking Software** are 600.000 € for development 
and planning. With the developed application it is then 
possible to continue normal operations. Therefore, the 
benefits outweigh the costs.

## Goal of the project (S,Q,T,B)

The application that should be developed in this project 
is necessary to continue operation of the airline, as it 
should be used to manage all flights, and the complete 
booking system.

### Background information

The customer for this project is an airline company that 
needs a new application to support the sales of flight 
tickets. Therefore, the newly developed application has to be integrated into the existing infrastructure.

## Project Scope (S)
Defining the general project scope includes several deliverables. To guarantee the project's  success it is 
necessary to seperate work into intermediate steps with each its own deliverables.
The project is mainly divided into two main parts, analysis and realisation. Both include multiple documents about 
the project. Analysis deals with planning and structuring the project, in the first place. On the other side, 
realisation is all about implementing the results of analysis and create the application itself.

### Project Definition
The Project consists of an application, that will be used to book, create and organize flights. This Application 
is divided into a server and multiple clients, so that multiple employees can book and manage flights concurrently.

### Project scope and exclusions
- On high level the following aspects of “enterprise architecture” will be impacted by the **Business Application 
  Flight Booking Software** project:

| Architecture aspect | Involved entities |
| ------ | -------- |
| Organization | Project Owner |
| Process | Project Development Team |
| Information | Project Development Team |
| System | Project Development Team |
| Infrastructure | Project Development Team |

#### Not in Scope:
The actual payment is not part of the application and is not necessary to consider.

###	Relations & interfaces
Below the main external relations and interfaces the **Business Application Flight Booking Software** project has to take into account:
- vision changes of the Owner that cause refactoring

Products and Services to be delivered
- 

## Approach (S,Q,T,B)
The general approach starts with analyzing the specified customer's needs and requirements. The analysis consists of 
several deliverables that contain necessary information for further development:
- User Stories that define requirements 
- Data Dicitionary to define important entities
- Domain Model including the specified entities  
- Use Case Description and Use Case Diagram
- Test scenarios with explicit values
- Activity Diagram
- Class Diagram 
- Sequence Diagram
- Database Design

## Quality (Q)

### Customer quality expectations
These statements describe when the project and its effects afterwards will be considered successful by the demanding customer:
- easy handling
- intuitive UI
- Useable for every Usergroup
- working scenarios

### Acceptance criteria
The application should allow the airline and its employees to manage flights, and the sales of flight tickets with the application

### Prerequisites & Constraints
The project deliverables have to be finished in time 

## Time and effort (T)

| Project phase | Lead time | Business effort | IT effort |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Startup and Initiation | 24 | 20 | 4 |
| Sprints: (Design, Realization and Confirmation, deployment) | 30 | 10 | 20 |
| Final deployment and go live | 24 | 4 | 20 |

## Outline Business Case (B)

### Alignment with corporate strategy
The main business drivers for the flight sale application are
- Increase efficiency in flight sales
- Decrease dependence on third party business applications

Achieving this by realizing the system changes and implementing the work approach according to the improved concepts and
process is a must-have item before the roll-out of **Business Application Flight Booking Software** can be started up again.

#### Benefits
- Reducing time for booking process
- Adapted to our needs and to our existing infrastructure
- Increased efficiency 

#### Costs
600.000 € in employee costs

## Risks and assumptions (R)
During the investigation for this Project Charter several risks were mentioned:
- Concept and process discussion takes too long to achieve the desired quality level
- Implementation of the planned features takes to long
- It cannot be guaranteed to consider potential requirement-changes just-in-time

For the creation of the PID these risks will be analyzed and where relevant translated into extra activities or 
checkpoints in the project. Risk owners will be appointed then to monitor the evolution of the risks


## Organization (O)
